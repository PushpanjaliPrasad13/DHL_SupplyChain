## 1. Project Overview
DHL Supply Chain, the world's leading logistics provider, required an effective solution to monitor and track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Orders, Products Sold, Revenue, Overhead Costs, Availability, and Defect Rate across its global operations. The lack of a unified, real-time reporting system was impacting decision-making and operational efficiency, especially in areas related to product stock levels and availability. Additionally, the business needed detailed insights into product group performance and comprehensive data analysis to identify trends and optimize logistics processes.
